
Application Services : 

SNS : SImple Notifications Service : 
--> We can create a Topic, We can add subscribers (email, website endpoint, sqs, mobile). 
--> Subscriber need to confirm the subscription. 
--> Push based messaging service. 

SNS also supports Push notifications service. Works based on mobile operating systems. 

__

SQS : Simple Queue service : pull based messeging service. 
Ex: AutoScaling group works with sqs service. 

--> Standard 
At-least-once delivery, message ordering isn't preserved
At-least once delivery
Best-effort ordering

--> FIFO (Name should end with .fifo) 
First-in-first-out delivery, message ordering is preserved
First-in-first-out delivery
Exactly-once processin

Maximum message size : 256 kb  (AWS cost us based on chunks)
1 chunk = 64 kb..   

1 million req under free tier eligibility.

__________

SES : Simple Email Service : If we want to send messeges on behalf of another email / domain name, We can use SES service. 

--> For bulk email sending, we need to use another service "Amazon pinpoint".

"S3/codecommit/git" --> Deploy to "ElasticBeanstalk"

IDE within AWS : Cloud9

_________________________________________________________

AWS Lambda : Serverless architecture. 
--> Lambda performance depends on memory configurations. 

--> Python
--> .net core
--> java
--> go
--> ruby
--> Node.js

Lambda-canary : It open the required website and look for the string we have given.

google.com --> Google

--> Incresing the memory and timeout values.
--> Changing the required [permissions on lambda associated roles. 
--> Can we run lambda within a VPC..?? YES
	--> FOr Lambda role Make sure you associate "AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole"


task : Am sharing some lambda functions... Deploy the lambda functions and test it. 

______________________

AWS Cloudformation : IaC Infrastructure as Code : JSON/YAML : 
--> it's free.

Prepare a cloudformation stack. This stack are reusable.
--> CLoudformation created resources will delete automatically when we delete the cloudformation stack.

rollback on failure : yes

2 ec2 instance, 3 s3 bucket, 1 rds instance

Cloud9 : IDE with in AWS environment. 

AWS CDK : Cloud Development kit : Typescript, Python, .net, Java

Step 1 : install node.js 	npm --version
Step 2 : Install AWS CDK	npm install -g aws-cdk
	  To Verify CDK verion	cdk --version

cdk init		--> Initialise the project

mkdir test-project
cd test-project
cdk init sample-app --language typescript
cdk synth		--> Synthasise, Create a cloudformation script
cdk bootstrap		--> Only onetime
cdk diff		--> What modifications happens
lib/test-project-stack.ts	--> Our code is here

ECR : Elastic Containers Repository : Place to store container images.
ECS : Elastic Container Service : 

Fargate : Fully managed by AWS. No backend instance, AWS manages everything.
EC2 : we will get an instance, COnstainers runs within instance, We can login and perform os level operations.


Task Defination : Task definitions specify the container information for your application, such as how many containers are part of your task, what resources they will use, how they are linked together, and which host ports they will use.

awsvpc — The task is allocated its own elastic network interface (ENI) and a primary private IPv4 address. This gives the task the same networking properties as Amazon EC2 instances.
bridge — The task utilizes Docker's built-in virtual network which runs inside each Amazon EC2 instance hosting the task.
host — The task bypasses Docker's built-in virtual network and maps container ports directly to the ENI of the Amazon EC2 instance hosting the task. As a result, you can't run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single Amazon EC2 instance when port mappings are used.
none — The task has no external network connectivity.
